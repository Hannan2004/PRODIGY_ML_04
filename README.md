# Hand Gesture Recognition with Mediapipe

## Overview

This project implements a hand gesture recognition system using the [Mediapipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) library. The goal is to recognize and classify hand gestures in real-time using the hand landmarks provided by the library.

## Features

- Real-time Hand Landmark Detection: Utilizes the hand tracking module of Mediapipe to detect and track landmarks on the hand.
- Gesture Recognition: Implements a gesture recognition model to classify hand gestures based on the detected landmarks.
- Visualization: Provides visualizations of hand landmarks and recognized gestures on input images or video streams.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Mediapipe
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install mediapipe matplotlib numpy

git clone https://github.com/Hannan2004/PRODIGY_ML_04.git

cd PRODIGY_ML_04
```
